# Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interrupts Fix

## Problem
The HITL interrupts were not working properly - instead of showing a dropdown UI, they were only displaying plain text messages asking the user what they wanted.

## Root Cause
The issue was that when the agent passed an interrupt value as a dictionary/object, the CopilotKit runtime was JSON stringifying it before sending it to the frontend. However, the frontend code was expecting the `eventValue` to be an object, not a JSON string, so the condition checks were failing.

## Solution
Updated the frontend `useLangGraphInterrupt` hooks to:
1. Parse the `eventValue` if it's a string in the `enabled` function
2. Parse the `event.value` if it's a string in the `render` function

This ensures that both string and object formats are handled correctly.

## Files Changed
1. **src/app/page.tsx** - Updated both HITL interrupt handlers to parse JSON strings
2. **agent/agent.py** - Cleaned up debug logging and removed unnecessary try/catch blocks

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Card Type Selection
1. Open the application
2. Type "add an item" or "create a card" (without specifying a type)
3. **Expected**: A dropdown should appear asking "Which type of card should I create?" with options for Project, Entity, Note, and Chart
4. Select a card type and click "Use type"
5. **Expected**: The agent should create an item of the selected type

### Test 2: Item Selection for Updates
1. Create multiple items (at least 2)
2. Type "update the item" or "rename the item" (without specifying which one)
3. **Expected**: A dropdown should appear asking "Which item should I use?" with a list of all available items
4. Select an item and click "Select"
5. **Expected**: The agent should perform the action on the selected item

## Technical Details
- The `copilotkit_interrupt` function in the agent sends interrupt values that get processed by the runtime
- The runtime's `emitInterrupt` function JSON stringifies object values when sending them to the frontend
- The frontend `useLangGraphInterrupt` hook now handles both pre-parsed objects and JSON strings
