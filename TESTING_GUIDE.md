# Testing Guide for Canvas with LangGraph Python

This guide helps verify that all the fixes have been properly implemented.

## Setup
1. Make sure both servers are running:
   - Frontend: Should be running on http://localhost:3000
   - Agent: Should be running on http://localhost:8123

2. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000

## Test Cases

### 1. Tool Message Validation ✅
**Expected**: No more "Invalid parameter: messages with role 'tool'" errors in the console.
- The agent now validates and cleans up orphaned tool messages before sending to OpenAI
- Check the terminal logs for the agent - you should see warnings about skipped orphaned tool messages

### 2. Messages Not Disappearing During Plan Execution ✅
**Test Steps**:
1. Ask the agent to create a plan (e.g., "Create a project management plan with 3 steps")
2. Watch as the plan executes

**Expected**:
- All agent messages should remain visible during plan execution
- Messages should never disappear and reappear
- Progress updates should show alongside regular messages

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop: Item Selection ✅
**Test Steps**:
1. Create multiple items (e.g., "Create a project called Test Project" and "Create a note called Test Note")
2. Ask to modify an item without specifying which one (e.g., "Change the item name to Updated")

**Expected**:
- A dropdown should appear asking which item you want to modify
- After selection, the modification should apply to the correct item

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop: Card Type Selection ✅
**Test Steps**:
1. Ask to create an item without specifying the type (e.g., "Create a new item" or "Add a card")

**Expected**:
- A dropdown should appear with options: Project, Entity, Note, Chart
- After selection, the appropriate item type should be created

### 5. Plan UI Improvements ✅
**Test Steps**:
1. Create and execute a plan
2. Wait for the plan to complete

**Expected**:
- After completion, the plan summary should appear collapsed by default
- There should be appropriate spacing between the plan summary and the confirmation message
- The accordion should be expandable to view plan details

## Code Improvements Made

1. **Message Validation**: Added `_validate_message_sequence()` to clean orphaned tool messages
2. **Message Persistence**: All messages are now always included in responses
3. **HITL Interrupts**: Properly imported and implemented `copilotkit_interrupt`
4. **Code Cleanup**: 
   - Removed unnecessary complexity and comments
   - Simplified system prompts
   - Extracted helper functions for better organization
   - Improved error handling

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check both server consoles for error messages
2. Refresh the browser and try again
3. Restart both servers if needed:
   ```bash
   # Kill existing processes
   pkill -f "pnpm dev"
   pkill -f "langgraph dev"
   
   # Restart
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Known Limitations
- The agent uses GPT-4o model, ensure your OpenAI API key has access
- Tool message validation warnings in console are expected and normal
