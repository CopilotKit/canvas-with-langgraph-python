# CopilotKit LangSmith Deployment Fix

## Issue

When deploying to LangSmith, you may encounter the following error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langgraph.graph.graph'
```

This occurs because CopilotKit v0.1.63 has an incorrect import path that tries to import from `langgraph.graph.graph`, which doesn't exist in current versions of LangGraph.

## Solution

The patch is embedded directly in `agent.py` at the beginning of the file, before any imports. This ensures it works in any deployment environment.

### How it works

1. The patch creates a fake module at `langgraph.graph.graph`
2. It imports `CompiledStateGraph` from the correct location (`langgraph.graph.state`)
3. It assigns `CompiledStateGraph` to `CompiledGraph` in the fake module
4. This allows CopilotKit's incorrect import to succeed

### Implementation

The patch is automatically applied at the top of `agent.py`:

```python
# Apply patch for CopilotKit import issue before any other imports
# This fixes the incorrect import path in copilotkit.langgraph_agent (bug in v0.1.63)
import sys

# Only apply the patch if the module doesn't already exist
if 'langgraph.graph.graph' not in sys.modules:
    # ... patch implementation ...
```

## Important Notes

- This is a temporary workaround until CopilotKit fixes the import issue
- The patch is embedded inline to ensure it works in deployment environments
- This issue affects CopilotKit version 0.1.63 when used with LangGraph 0.6.x
- The patch only applies if the module doesn't already exist, making it safe to run multiple times

## Future Fix

Once CopilotKit releases a version that fixes this import issue, you can:
1. Update CopilotKit: `pip install copilotkit --upgrade`
2. Remove the patch code from the top of `agent.py`
3. The version constraints in `requirements.txt` help prevent future breaking changes
